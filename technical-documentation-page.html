    Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?

    Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Yes, Yes, without the oops! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

    Did he just throw my cat out of the window? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I was part of something special. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.

    We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

Must go faster. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
