    Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?

    Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Yes, Yes, without the oops! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

    Did he just throw my cat out of the window? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I was part of something special. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.

    We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

Must go faster. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

  <h2>Years Of Experience</h2>

  <h4>First Year</h4>
  <p>
    They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists.
  </p>

    <h4>Second Year</h4>
  <p> 
    I was part of something special. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
  </p>

    <h4>Third Year</h4>
  <p>
     Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. What do they got in there? King Kong? You really think you can fly that thing? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?
  </p>

  <h4>Fourth Year</h4>
  <p>
    I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I was part of something special. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
